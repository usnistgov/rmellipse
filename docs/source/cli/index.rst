Command Line Interface
======================

.. attention::

   The rmellipse CLI is designed to interact with an instance of NIST's CDCS_ that
   is configured to behave as a repository that serves datasets and their
   metrological records. It is under active development, and this interface
   is expected to be extremely volatile. Instructions to configure and host
   this data archive are not a part of this repository. Documentation is presented
   only as part of the development process.
