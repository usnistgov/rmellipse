Welcome to Rocky Mountain Ellipse's documentation!
==================================================

Rocky Mountain Ellipse (RME) is a software package designed to provide an explicit digital record of the metrological
traceability of a measurement result. In other words, RME will allows users to build a record that describes how
a measurement result can be related to a reference through a documented unbroken chain of calibrations,
each contributing to the measurement uncertainty. To show the traceability of measurements,
RME provides a flexible, explicit system to organize and annotate scientific data and data analysis workflows.Because measurement
uncertainty is closely related to traceability, RME allows users to track how the uncertainty of a measurement results
derives from other measurements by providing tools to facilitate measurement uncertainty propagation (linear finite-difference and Monte-Carlo)
through arbitrary Python functions. The system is compatible with the BIPM Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM_).
RME is intended to be part of a FAIR_ software ecosystem that will facilitate re-use of code and data.
This vision includes an online archive that could eventually store records of NISTâ€™s entire traceability chain, and beyond. As part of that vision,
this package focuses on the development of three core utilities:
